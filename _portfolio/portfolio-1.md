title: "3D reconstruction of human organ from endoscope video"
excerpt: "This ongoing work focuses on developing and improving 3D reconstruction pipeline using endoscopic videos from human organ examinations. 3D reconstruction of surface shape and texture of human organ from endoscopic videos can embed both geomet- rical and texture information in the 3D representation of shape and appearance, thus it is more convenient to review, compare and store this kind of representation of endoscopic data. Furthermore, the generated 3D model can potentially be displayed in AR environment for robotic guidance during telesurgery or assistant system during medical training.<br/><img src='/images/YZ-cysto3D-1.png'>"
